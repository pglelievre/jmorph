### Bugs squashed
- If image files exist but can not be read, the GUI now indicates this correctly (can happen for some CMYK and tiff images). Also added an appropriate error message when this happens.
- Sample info panel was displaying a sample after removing the last one (a very minor insignificant issue).

## 2018-01-11
### Changed
- Added better cross-platform support (newline characters for non *nix platforms).
